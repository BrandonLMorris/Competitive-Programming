# Competitive-Programming
Source code from algorithmic programming practice and competition

As a hobby, I really enjoy solving algorthmic puzzles with programming. This repository is a collection
of the code from that hobby. Please note that some of this code is a solid year old from the first
commit. I've learned a lot about Computer Science and programming since I began, and the quality
from early on is likely sub-par.

Ideally, I'll go back and refactor the code to make it more digestible.
